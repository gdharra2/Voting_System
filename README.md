# Background
Various voting systems are being studied to determine an effective system for selecting the most eligible and suitable candidate. The different systems include plurality, runoff, Borda, Condorcet, and score voting. The below description provides a brief understanding of the various systems stated:

1. Plurality: The simplest system wherein each person casts one vote for their favorite candidate and the candidate with the most votes wins.
2. Runoff: It is similar to plurality except that, after the first round of voting, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated and the election is repeated with the remaining candidates.
3. Borda: In this system, voters don’t vote for a single candidate, rather they rank the candidates and each candidate receives points respective to their rank.
4. Condocert: It runs pairwise popular elections between every possible pair of candidates. If a single candidate beats all others in these pairwise elections, that candidate is the winner.
5. Score Voting: A system in which each voter gives each candidate a score on some scale and the candidate with the highest average score wins. One noteworthy difference of this system is that it does not require any ranking of the candidates since a voter can give multiple candidates the same score.

# Hypothesis
1. The Condorcet system of voting may work the best in selecting a suitable candidate since every candidate is ranked with every other pair of candidates and the most favorable candidate gets to win.
2. The Score Voting is vulnerable to strategic manipulation since the score is very subjective and quantitative.
